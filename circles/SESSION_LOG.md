# Peerify — Session Log

Live at: https://peerify.one  ·  Staging: https://staging.peerify.one
(This log was migrated from the Kamooni/Circles repo during the 2026-06 split; entries before ~June 2026 describe Kamooni lineage and shared Circles work.)

## Current Status (2026-06-27)
- Production: https://peerify.one — live, HTTPS (nginx + Certbot), PM2 process `peerify` on :3000, branch `main`.
- Staging:    https://staging.peerify.one — live, isolated, PM2 process `peerify-staging` on :3001, branch `staging`.
- Build tool: bun. Runtime: Next.js standalone via PM2 (not Docker).
- See OPERATIONS.md for full architecture and deploy procedure.

## 2026-06-27 — Staging environment + two isolation-bug fixes

Headline: Stood up a fully isolated staging environment at staging.peerify.one,
then discovered and fixed two latent isolation bugs where staging was silently
sharing production's live data. Production left running untouched throughout;
prod deploy of the fixes is still pending (deliberate, scheduled separately).

What was built / changed:
- Staging environment on the same server as prod:
  - git worktree at /home/tim/apps/peerify-staging/circles on branch `staging`
  - PM2 process `peerify-staging` on port 3001, loading its own .env.local via --env-file
  - separate DB (peerify_staging), separate MinIO bucket (circles-staging),
    separate APP_DIR (peerify-staging-data) for user keys, fresh JWT/ALTCHA secrets
  - nginx server block for staging.peerify.one → :3001, Let's Encrypt cert
  - bun installed user-level on the host (prod build had been done elsewhere)
- Fixed Stripe apiVersion type error blocking the build
  (commit: align Stripe apiVersion with installed library type).
- ISOLATION BUG 1 — db.ts hardcoded client.db("circles") and ignored MONGODB_URI,
  so staging was reading/writing PRODUCTION's database. Fixed to derive the DB name
  from the URI. Verified: staging now uses peerify_staging (empty map = success),
  prod's circles DB unchanged. (commit on `staging`)
- ISOLATION BUG 2 — storage.ts hardcoded bucketName = "circles", so staging image
  UPLOADS were landing in PRODUCTION's bucket (reads correctly used circles-staging,
  causing broken images — "split-brain"). Fixed to read MINIO_BUCKET. Verified:
  fresh staging uploads now land in circles-staging and display. (commit on `staging`)
- Cleaned up 5 stray staging test files that had leaked into prod's `circles` bucket
  (moved to circles-staging via copy-verify-then-remove; prod bucket count 36 → 31,
  no other prod objects touched).
- Made tim@socialsystems.io an admin on staging (isAdmin:true in peerify_staging only;
  prod circles DB untouched).

Environment facts learned / confirmed:
- Prod is NOT Docker — bare Node via PM2, env loaded inline (--update-env on restart).
- The Next.js standalone build does NOT copy .next/static or public; they must be
  copied next to server.js after every build or CSS/images break.
- The "circles" hardcode is a recurring class of bug from the Kamooni lineage;
  more instances may exist — audit pending.

Still pending (carried forward):
- Deploy the db.ts + storage.ts fixes to prod (merge staging→main, rebuild, one
  deliberate ~2-5s PM2 restart at a low-traffic moment).
- Script the deploy (must include the static-copy step).
- pm2 save so peerify-staging survives reboot.
- Audit codebase for other hardcoded "circles".
- Doc hygiene: ARCHITECTURE.md / SESSION_LOG header / CLAUDE.md are stale (Kamooni/npm).
- Audio-pipeline feature is now testable on staging (was the original goal of staging).
- Product question: artist profile setup via Create vs Settings (separate from personal identity).
